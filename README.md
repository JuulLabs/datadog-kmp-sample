# Datadog KMP Sample

Suite of sample applications demonstrating usage of the [Datadog KMP] (Kotlin multiplatform) library.

The sample apps depend on a common library that provides Datadog client tokens, the tokens should be
configured by adding them to `library/local.properties` file as follows:

```
datadog.clientToken.android=YOUR_ANDROID_CLIENT_TOKEN
datadog.clientToken.ios=YOUR_IOS_CLIENT_TOKEN
datadog.clientToken.js=YOUR_JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_TOKEN
```

## Android

The Android sample app can be built and installed via [Android Studio], or via command line by
executing:

```shell
./gradlew installDebug
```

## iOS

The iOS sample app demonstrates using the [Datadog KMP] library by means of a Framework that exposes
[Datadog KMP] protocols that are implemented in the app layer using official Datadog dependencies
pulled directly into the iOS app.

Due to limitations with Kotlin Multiplatform, applications can reasonably only have a single Kotlin
dependency â€” the `library` module is used to produce the Framework used in the sample app, and shows
how [Datadog KMP] can be integrated into an existing library.

Kotlin/Native does not provide official support for SPM (Swift package manager), as a result, the
sample app pulls in Datadog SPM dependency directly and implements the necessary [Datadog KMP]
protocols.

The sample app can be opened in Xcode by executing:

```shell
./gradlew openXcode
```

_Requires `xcodegen` installed via Homebrew (`xcodegen` located at `/opt/homebrew/bin/xcodegen`, or
modify `ios/build.gradle.kts` `generateXcodeProject` task)._

## JavaScript

To build and launch the demo within a browser window, run:

```shell
./gradlew jsBrowserRun
```
